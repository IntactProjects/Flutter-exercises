# Flutter Exercices

## Exercises

- [Exercise 1](../master/exo1/README.md) - Learn the basics about state management
- [Exercise 2](../master/exo2/README.md) - Learn about layout composition, navigation, WS calls and Google Maps integration

## Submit your work

To submit your work:
- Clone the repository
- Checkout the `master` branch 
- Go into the exercise folder (`exo1`, `exo2`, etc.)
- Create a branch named `work/exoX-[your-name]` (for example `work/exo1-nicopico`)
- Then create a PR against this branch with the name `Exo X - My Name`, for example `Exo 1 - Nicolas P.`

This PR will never be accepted (sorry :wink:) but will be used to check your work and make some feedback.
